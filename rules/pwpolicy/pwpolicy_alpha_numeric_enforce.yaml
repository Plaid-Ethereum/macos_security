title: "Require Passwords Contain a Minimum of One Numeric Character"
discussion: |
  The iOS _MUST_ be configured to require at least one numeric character be used when a password is created.

  This rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users. 
check: |
  Check your MDM to ensure that alpha numeric passwords have been enforced on the iOS endpoint.
result:
  string: "true"
fix: |
  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
