title: "Prevent synching of recent recipients."
discussion: |
  The iOS device needs some specific configurations for the Exchange setup to meet the minimum requirements. Some are mandatory.

  The synchronization of recent addresses _SHOULD_ be prevented not to synchronize sensitive addresses locally to the device.
check: |
  Check your MDM to ensure that disabling recent mail address sync has been enforced on the iOS endpoint, if decided by the CISO.
result:
  string: "true"
fix: |
  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
